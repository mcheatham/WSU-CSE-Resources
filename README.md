Recommendations and websites to look at to give yourself a summer project

## Summer / Personal Projects
### Learn New Stuff!
The focus of learning any one computer language is to nail down the basics.  Maybe code will look  
a little different, but the important things like making a variable, using loops, if statements,  
and conditional or relational operators are all fundamentals that every language utilizes.
* Python (3.6 or higher)
    * Python is very beginner friendly, which is why you see such a high adaptation of it in so  
        many different fields.
    * Author's Note: Python 2.7 released its final version, so it's worth focusing on 3.6+
* Java
    * Java is utilized heavily in our intro level courses, so it may be worth poking around at now  
        to get ahead of the curve!
* C / C++
    * Super useful for hardware / optimization focus.  Utilized in higher level courses
* Bash / Scripting / Linux
    * Linux is an operating system that is wonderful for development (and very useful to your learning
        at Wright State).  
        You can start fidgeting with Linux in a variety of ways:
        * Raspberry Pi - a computer that only runs Linux.  The entire system runs off an SD card, so  
        if you fidgeting goes arwy, you reinstall the SD card and you're off again!
        * Virtual Machines - VMWare and Virtual Box are programs that let you use "guest" operating 
        systems.  
        So instead of installing only Linux on your computer, you can keep Windows and run Linux when  
        you feel like dabbling.
    * WSL Ubuntu - for Windows users
    * Terminal - for Mac / Chromebook users.  Note that we do not recommend Macs for our program
* Git (and GitHub)
    * You are creating these wonderful projects, learn how to share them with the world!
    * Git is a version control system.  It is also a fantastic resume builder.

### Course Samples
Sample labs of freshman / sophmore level courses from Spring 2020
* [CEG 2170 - C for Engineers](https://github.com/pattonsgirl/Spring2020-CEG2170)
    * Elective course for learning C.  Geared towards non-CSE students
* [CEG 2350 - OS Concepts and Usage](https://github.com/pattonsgirl/Spring2020-CEG2350)
    * Required course for CS / CEG majors.
    * Provides and introduction to Linux, Git, scripting, OS concepts, virtual machines,  
        development technologies
### Blinky Lights!

### E-Books!
* [HumbleBundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/)
    * Known for deals on games, but they also create e-book collections.  They change topics 
    and themes every few week, but usually have at least a couple technology options.

### Computer Recommendations
When in-person, there are lots of computer labs on campus.  A course that requires coding is usually  
taught in a lab with computers in it for the students.  That said, our FAQs frequently circle back to,  
"What computer do I need for this program?"  So here are some guidelines.
* We do **NOT** recommend Macs as your primary computer.
    * If you have a Mac, you may have trouble finding alternatives to software used in our program
    * You will also to to ensure your code is compatible with the system that it will be graded on
* We strongly recommend Windows or Linux.
* Processor: Try to have at minimum an Intel i5 processor (or it's AMD equivalent)
* Storage: Try to get at minimum a 256 GB SSD (Solid State Drive)
* Graphics: No requirement here.  We utilize servers with GPUs and cloud services like AWS for courses  
that need access to graphics for learning / computation
