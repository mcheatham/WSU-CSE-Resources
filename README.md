Recommendations and websites to look at to give yourself a summer project

## Summer / Personal Projects
### Learn a Language!
The focus of learning any one computer language is to nail down the basics.  Maybe code will look  
a little different, but the important things like making a variable, using loops, if statements,  
and conditional or relational operators are all fundamentals that every language utilizes.
* Python (3.6 or higher)
    * Python is very beginner friendly, which is why you see such a high adaptation of it in so  
        many different fields.
    * Author's Note: Python 2.7 released its final version, so it's worth focusing on 3.6+
* Java
    * Java is utilized heavily in our intro level courses, so it may be worth poking around at now  
        to get ahead of the curve!
* C / C++
    * Super useful for hardware / optimization focus.  Utilized in higher level courses

### Computer Recommendations
When in-person, there are lots of computer labs on campus.  A course that requires coding is usually  
taught in a lab with computers in it for the students.  That said, our FAQs frequently circle back to,  
"What computer do I need for this program?"  So here are some guidelines.
* We do not recommend Macs as your primary computer.
    * If you have a Mac, you may have trouble finding alternatives to software used in our program
    * You will also to to ensure your code is compatible with the system that it will be graded on
* We strongly recommend Windows or Linux.
* Processor: Try to have at minimum an Intel i5 processor (or it's AMD equivalent)
* Storage: Try to get at minimum a 256 GB SSD (Solid State Drive)
* Graphics: No requirement here.  We utilize servers with GPUs and cloud services like AWS for courses  
that need access to graphics for learning / computation
